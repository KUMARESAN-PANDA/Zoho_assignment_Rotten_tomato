# Zoho Assignment - Rotten Tomato Audience Rating Predictor

This project aims to predict audience ratings for movies based on multiple features such as genre, release year, cast, and audience reviews. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to provide an accurate prediction of audience sentiment and ratings.

## Features
- **Input Features**: Genre, Cast, Release Year, Audience Reviews, etc.
- **Output**: Predicted Audience Rating (on a scale of 1 to 10).
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Machine Learning (scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), and Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KUMARESAN-PANDA/Zoho_assignment_Rotten_tomato.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Zoho_assignment_Rotten_tomato
   ```


## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by adding it to the `dataset` directory (ensure the correct format).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook movie_rating_prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and test it with new data.


## Model

- **Algorithm**: algorithm used Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.]
- **Performance Metrics**: metrics like RMSE, MAE, R-squared, etc.



## Future Scope

- Improve feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Integrate a web interface for user input and predictions.
- Experiment with deep learning models for better performance.
